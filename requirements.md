# If you go the front-end route, these will be your technical requirements:

Use React for the front end.

Use a Node.js and Express.js server.

Be deployed using Heroku.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## It will be nice for your application to have these technical features:
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Include authentication (JWT).
